These are incomplete examples intending to help with learning
advanced features of MPI. Follow numbered directories in order
and read the Readme files at the bottom level to see what to do.

All of these examples are present in completed format in the 
"MPI_Tutorial" repository, along with other codes that demonstrate 
other elements of MPI. They are well worth looking at as well

Remember that in these example it is almost always acceptable to use
MPI_INFO_NULL for an MPI_Info object
MPI_STATUS_IGNORE for an MPI_Status object
and MPI_STATUSES_IGNORE for an array of MPI_Status objects
